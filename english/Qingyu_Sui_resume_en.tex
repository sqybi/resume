                     This service is a wrapper for our machine learning based lane fitting algorithm. It can get video input from Point Grey camera, get raw lane information by the lane fitting algorithm, then re-format and send it to Human Machine Interface (HMI) and CAN bus on the truck.\newline{}%
                     It also works as a bridge between CAN bus and HMI. HMI can send some commands to CAN bus by communicating with Lane Fitting Service, as well as get car status (speed, throttle, etc.) from it.\newline{}%
                     Responsible for design and implementation of the whole system.
               \item Hwcap Video Collection System on TX1\newline{}%
                     Hwcap is a multi-way input video collection system which works on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 embedded platform. It will collect eight-way videos from eight cameras which is connected to three MAX9286 Deserializers\footnotemark[1]{}, and then process, encode, compress and store the video using the hardware encoding module on TX1. It can also check its own working status and report to a central server.\newline{}%
                     Responsible for design of the whole system and implementation of the TX1 video collection/encoding/storage part.
